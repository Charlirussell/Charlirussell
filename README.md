💖✨ Hey, I’m Charli – Your Friendly Neighborhood Code Sorceress 🪄💫

 
🌟 About Me


🎨 I’m a Frontend Web Developer with a serious love for problem-solving (Yep, I'm the one that cheers where there are bugs to fix 🐛)

🎮 When I’m not coding, I’m probably gaming (World of Warcraft vibes 🪄✨) or adventuring outside with Pluto, my Australian Shepherd and partner-in-crime 🐾

☕ Powered by caramel lattes, good vibes, and caffeinated fairy dust 🧚‍♀️

💻 Tech I Love


🛠️ Languages: JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS

🎨 Frameworks & Tools: React 💙, Sass, Tailwind

☁️ Cloud Platforms: Firebase & Netlify

🖥️ OS: Windows & Android (Apple? Nah 🙅‍♂️)

🌱 Currently Exploring


🤖 Currently diving headfirst into Generative AI 🧠

🐍 Learning Python because it’s time to join the AI magic-makers club 🪄

🔍 Constantly keeping an eye on cutting-edge web tech, so I can stay updated on ways to sprinkle that futuristic flair into my projects 💫


🎯 What I’m Up To


🚧 Building fusion-digital.fr (Why is making your own site always the hardest thing? RAHHH 😤)

🔨 Renovating my house like it’s a life-sized LEGO project 🏠

🕺 Fun Facts

🐶 Dog mama to Pluto, the world's best Australian Shepherd (totally unbiased) 🐾

🌍 I’m obsessed with exploring—whether it’s new tech or a new hiking trail 🌲

🎮 Will happily spend hours raiding dungeons in World of Warcraft or levelling up IRL! ⬆️
